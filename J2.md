1. 
   Strings are an object, while every other variable in this example is a basic 
type

2.
  A)  static method is a method that shares all of its variables with other 
methods that are deemed static
  B) a main method needs to be static so that it can be called without creating an 
instance of a class that contains the main() function

3.
   Program 1: Wrong
   Program 2: Correct

4. No, the below program does not change the season becasue season isn't a static 
variable. This means that season will only change locally within the change_season 
function. 

5. The output of this program is 0,0. The reason for this is that the point method 
is missing "this" in it's assignment of x and y. Without "this", the program will 
assign inputs to each other, but not change the main parameters of the object.

6.

  Private allows methods to only be obtained through the use of getters and 
setters. This also allows variables and methods of a class to only be accessed 
from within the class itself.

7.
    Java chooses based on the user input. If the user calls point with two 
parameters(two doubles), it will use that version. Otherwise, java will call the 
Point method that uses a Point object.

8.
   Option 4

9. "(0, 0)"

10. "(10, 10)"

11. Option 1
	
	We want to override sum_x_y so we have to name our replacement function 
the same way.
 
12. A protected value can be accessed within the class, in a subclass, or in the 
same package.

13. 
     public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
	private String make;
	
	public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String m){
	     super(n, d);
	     make = m;
	}
  
     }
	

14.

   Neither will run since this method is being ran in main which is a 
different class than the protected method.

		
15.  Interns will have the same relationships with the Unit as employees, except that the 
interns will have a boolean that indicates whether their contract is expiring or not.
